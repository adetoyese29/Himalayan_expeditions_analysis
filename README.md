# About Project
This project explores the rich history of the Nepalese Himalaya mountaineering expeditions.
For over seven decades, Nepal’s Himalayan peaks have captivated climbers from around the globe — drawn by the allure of the highest summits on Earth. From the first triumph on Annapurna I in 1950 to the countless modern attempts on Everest and beyond, these mountains have witnessed human ambition, endurance, tragedy, and triumph.

This dashboard unpacks rich expedition data from the Himalayan Database, offering insights into:

Who climbed which peaks, when, and how

The evolution of mountaineering over time

The life-or-death role of oxygen at altitude

Patterns in fatalities, rescues, and success rates

The impact of experience, nationality, and expedition strategy

Through numbers and visuals, we explore the extraordinary journeys that have shaped mountaineering history in the Nepalese Himalayas.
